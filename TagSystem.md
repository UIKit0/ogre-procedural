# Objectives #
  * Provide some additional metadata to the "triangle soup" or "segment soup"
  * The metadata should be flexible, ie it is generated by mesh generators, but can also be dynamically added or modified
  * Using the metadata would provide selection inside a TriangleBuffer, for example : triangle with tag "tag1" have material "material1" and those with "tag2" have material "material2"

# Implementation #
  * The tag system is linked to its "father", ie TriangleBuffer, Shape or Path.
  * A map between a string (the tag) and a set of either triangles, edges, vertices, or segments
  * The generators have tagging guidelines, for example the cylinder generator will create baseBottom, baseTop, and body
  * The tagsystem can be disabled at will, either locally or globally, since it may consume resources
  * A custom string can be prepended to the meshgenerators' tags, for example : "cylinder1.body"
  * Selection of tags can be made with wildcards, eg cylinder1.
